# Practical Assigment 3

## 16 October 2018

Compiled by Herman Myburgh & Alistair Yan


## Scenario

Use the BPSK simulation platform developed inPractical 1 to develop a simulation
platform to generate uncoded data blocks of lengthNu = 100. Use the convolutional
encoder shown below to encode the uncoded data in order to yieldNc = 300 coded data
bits.

Use the Viterbi algorithm to develop a decoder in order to determine the most probable
sequence of uncoded transmitted symbols. Plot the BER performance of the system and
compare it to the uncoded BPSK performance in an AWGN channel.

## Deliverables

- Write a report using LATEX. Reports that are not written using LATEX will not be
    marked.
- Report on your findings. Provide a detailed analysis. Be concise and use proper gram-
    mar.
- Include your code as an appendix using double columns

## Instructions

EDC320 – Practical Assignment 3 1


- All reports must be in PDF format and be named report.pdf.
- Place the software in a folder called SOFTWARE and the report in a folder called
    REPORT.
- Add the folders to a zip-archive and name it studnrEDC310prac3.zip.
- All reports and simulation software must be e-mailed toedc310.2018@gmail.com no
    later than 16h00 on 30 October. No late submissions will be accepted.
- Submit your hard copy in class or at Eng III 7-31.

## Additional Instructions

- Do not copy! The copier and the copyee (of software and/or documentation) will receive
    zero for both the software and the documentation. Z-e-r-o.
- For any questions of appointments email me atu14006007@tuks.co.za
- Make sure that you discuss the results that are obtained. This is a large part of writing
    a technical report.

## Marking

Your report will be marked as follow:

- 50% will be awarded for the full implementation of the practical and the subsequent
    results in the report. For partially completed practicals, marks will be awarded as seen
    fit by the marker.
- 50% will be awarded for the overall report. This includes everything from the report
    structure, grammar and discussion of results. The discussion will be the bulk of the
    marks awarded.
